

Any program has 3 parts
input 
process
output

The project that I would be working on
--------------------------------------
Book Mangement System
	- List all the books
	- Add a new book
	- Update an Existing book
	- Delete an Existing book
	- Exit

3 layered architecture - seperation of concerns
-----------------------
presentation layer
------------------
	- view of your application
	- take any inputs from the user and display any outputs on the console
	- inputs are done with Scanner API and outputs are done with System.out in a console based application
	- the main method will the presentation layer

service layer
-------------
	- is responsible for processing your inputs and returns back the output/result/computation back to the presentaion layer
	- if required it will call the methods of the dao layer
	- we should never work with Scanner API or System.out in the service
	- 

dao (Data Access Object) layer
------------------------------
	- my java would want ot interact with a Database. This is the right place to do it

flow of data 
-------------
presentation -> service -> Dao ->Database
	     <-         <-     <-

coupling
--------
loosely coupled project - we want to have this in the project
tightly coupled project

POJO - Plain Old Java Object
     - carry the data to and fro from one layer to another
     - a POJO is not a layer of your project
     - it is more like a data holder/encapsulator
