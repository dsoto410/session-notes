Wrapper classes
---------------

data-types in java
-------------------
	1) primitive data types
		- example : the 8 primitive data types
			byte
			short
			int
			long
			float
			double
			boolean
			char
		- primitive data types starts with small letter
		- primitive data types are not objects

	2) non-primitive data types / derived data-types
		- example : reference variables of objects, arrays

java gave us 8 equivalent wrapper classes for the 8 primitive data types

	
			byte        	Byte
			short		Short
			int		Integer
			long		Long
			float		Float
			double		Double
			boolean		Boolean
			char		Character


		int mark = 50; // primitive type
		Integer score = new Integer(70); // Wrapper class type

		boolean result = true;
		Boolean flag = new Boolean(true);

	from java 1.8 we have autoboxing concept
		int myMark = 70;
		Integer score = myMark; // here we are assigning a primitive type to a Wrapper type
		int finalScore = score; // here we are assigning a wrapper type to primitive type


Generics  - available from java 1.8 - uses objects which are Wrapper types
Collection - uses objects which are Wrapper types


String is like the universal data type
Have to know these conversions
-----------------------------
	- Wrapper types to String
		Integer mark = 60; // possible because of autoboxing other wise we should have said Integer mark = new Integer(60);
		String myMark = mark+"";
		String myMark1 = String.valueOf(mark); // another way
		

	- String to Wrapper types
		String number1 = "6";
		String number2 = "8";
		Integer n1 = Integer.parseInt(number1); // this parses the String and converts it to wrapper type Integer
		Integer n2 = Integer.parseInt(number2);

		String number3 = "45.67";
		Double n3 = Double.parseDouble(number3);
		
		String flag = "true";
		Boolean result = Boolean.parseBoolean(flag);

	- primitives to String
		int mark = 30;
		String myMark = mark+"";
		String myMark1 = String.valueOf(mark); // another way

	- String to primitive
		String number1 = "6";
		String number2 = "8";
		int n1 = Integer.parseInt(number1); // this parses the String and converts it to wrapper type Integer and stores it in primitive type - thanks to autoboxing
		int n2 = Integer.parseInt(number2);

		String number3 = "45.67";
		double n3 = Double.parseDouble(number3);
		
		String flag = "true";
		boolean result = Boolean.parseBoolean(flag);
		

"45", "true", "56.87"

"6" + "8" = 68
6 + 8 = 14

Variables scopes
----------------
	- it talks about the lifetime of the variable
   scopes of a variable
   ---------------------
	- class scope
		- instance variables
		- class Room{
			int length; // has class scope
		  }
		- these variables can be accessed by all the methods of the class
		- these variables take memory on heap
		- these variables lifetime are as long as the object is in heap

	- local scope
		- local variables
		- these variables are declared inside a method
		- they take memory in stack
		- their lifetime is until the method finishes its execution

	- block scope
		- we declare variables within a block
		- a block is { }
		- void display(){
			-----
			-----
			if(condn){
				int mark = 50;

			}
			// mark cannot be used here as it has a block scope which is inside if

		  }
		- the variable is available within the block

non access modifiers
--------------------
- final
	- in front of a variable
		- behaves like a constant
		- final double PI = 3.14;
			PI = 3.15; // compilation error
			System.out.println(PI); // valid
		- naming convention - all caps
			final int MIN_AGE = 21;
	
	- in front of a method definition
		- stops method overriding
		- none of the sub classes can overide a final method present in the super class

	- in front of a class
		- stops inheritence
		- we cannot extend a final class

a question to think about - Can I use abstract and final in front of a class?	no 

- synchronized
	- used in multithreading
	- in front of a method and can have synchronized block
	- used to make the resources safer/protect from multiple threads

- native
	- used in front of method
	- native methods are methods written in a language other than java
	- mostly c/c++

- transient
	- is used in front of instance variables
	- the variable which is transient is not persisted during Serialization
	- as a result the transient variable cannot be retrieved during Deserialization

- static
	- in front of a varibale
	- static variables occupy only one memory in heap for each object created
	- static variables are shared by different objects of the same type
	- static variables belong to the class and not to a particular object
	- when is memory for static variables allocated? it is allocated much before an obejct is created
	- when is memory for non-static variables allocated? whenever an object is created	
		
	- sequence of the steps
	-----------------------
	Room room5; // room5 is a local variable, so if not initiialized will hold garbage value
	1) The class gets loaded from secondary to the primary memory(RAM - JRE) - who does this ? the class loader which is a a part of the JRE
	2) Allocates memory for the static variables of that class
	3) static blocks are called/executed automatically in the order in which it is present

	room5 = new Room();
	4) Allocates memory for non-static variables
	5) constructors are automatically called

	Room room6 = new Room(); // this time step 1,2,3 will not work. Only step 4 and 5 will take place
	Room room6; // local variable is created
	room6 = new Room() // now a Room object is created and the local variable points to that object

	- now that static variables' memory is allocated even before the object is created, you can access static members using the class name
		Room.height = 150;

	
	

	
		class Room{
			int length;
			int width;
			static int height;

		}


		main()
			Room room1 = new Room();
			room1.setHeight(150);
				----
			Room room100 = new Room();
			room100.setHeight(150);

	- in front of a method
		- methods whose logic is common and not specific to an object can be made static
		- just like how static variables can be accessed using the class name, static methods can also be accessed using class name
			Room.doubleHeight();	

	- in front of a class
		- but it has to be an inner class

	- static blocks
		- just like how we have constructors to initialize non-static variables, static blocks are for intiializing static variables
		- can have any number of static blocks
		- they are automaticcaly called after memory for the static varaibles are allocated

		class Room{
			int length;
			int width;
			static int height;

			static{
				height = 150;
			}

			Room(int length, int width){
				this.length = length;
				this.width = width;
			}

			// other methods
		}

	questions
	---------
	1) can a static method access a non static member?
		no 
	2) can a non-static method access a static member?
		yes
